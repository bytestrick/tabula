# Tabula

The focus of this project lies on the architecture and the structure of a 3-layers web app. Thus, it doesn't address the issues of security and accessibility, which are addressed in another project.

This repository contains two subprojects, one is the backend of the app which is a Java-Springboot-PostgreSQL-Gradle application, while the other is the frontend of the app which is a TypeScript-Angular-NPM app.

TODO: add command to bootstrap-run the whole project.
